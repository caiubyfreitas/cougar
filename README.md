This project is a result of many years using Excel VBA code to automate spreadsheets. It compliles a long list of functions that can be used to reduce the amount of time necessary to automate any repetitive task or calculation you would need to create from scratch. In a sense, it provides you an all-purpose toolset. All the functions were organized into a single file, which is an Excel Add-in, that you can simply reference in your workbook in order to use them. 
That's it. Live long and proper.
